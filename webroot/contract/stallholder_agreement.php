      <p><b>19 DISPUTE RESOLUTION</b></p>
      <p><strong>19.1 Good Faith:</strong> If any dispute arises between the Organiser and the Stallholder concerning this Agreement, the parties will try in good faith to settle the matter by negotiation, and if that is unsuccessful, by mediation.</p>
      <p><strong>19.2 Arbitrator:</strong> If the dispute cannot be settled by negotiation or mediation, then the dispute will be referred to a sole arbitrator if the parties agree upon one, and if not then the dispute will be referred to an arbitrator appointed by the President of the New Zealand Law Society at the request of either party.</p>

      <hr />
      <p><b>20 NATURE OF THE COUNCIL</b></p>
      <p><strong>20.1 Organiser as Land Owner:</strong> The Organiser has entered into this Agreement in its non-regulatory capacity as land owner and administering body. This Agreement does not bind Council in its capacity as a regulatory authority in any way, and any consent or agreement the Organiser gives under this Agreement is not an agreement or consent of Council in its regulatory capacity and vice versa. When acting in its regulatory capacity, Council is entitled to consider all applications to it without regard to this Agreement. The Organiser will not be liable to the Stallholder or any other party if, Council in its regulatory capacity, declines or imposes conditions on any consent or permission the Stallholder or any other party seeks for any purpose associated with this Agreement.</p>
      <p><strong>20.2 Consent of Council:</strong> Where this Agreement requires the Stallholder to obtain any consent or approval of the Organiser, the Organiser will grant that consent or approval in its capacity as the owner of the Event Site only. The Stallholder must separately obtain through the relevant department of Council any consent or approval it requires from Council acting as regulatory authority. Similarly, any consent or approval the Stallholder obtains from Council acting as territorial authority, does not constitute the consent of the Organiser.</p>
      <hr />
      <p><b>21 COSTS</b></p>
      <p><strong>21.1</strong> Each party will bear its own costs and expenses in respect of the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement or any variation to it.</p>
      <hr />
      <p><b>22 MINISTER’S CONSENT</b></p>
      <p><strong>22.1</strong> Where, pursuant to the Classification of the Event Site under the Reserves Act, the Organiser is granting the licence under this Agreement acting on behalf of the Crown under the Reserves Act, then such grant and this Agreement are conditional upon the Minister of Conservation’s consent, which the Organiser will use its reasonable endeavours to obtain. If consent is not obtained, then the Organiser may cancel this Agreement.</p>
      <hr />
      <p><b>23 RESERVES ACT</b></p>
      <p><strong>23.1</strong> The covenants and provisions that are required to be included in this Agreement pursuant to the Reserves Act will apply to this Agreement to the extent that they are not expressly included in the terms of this Agreement.</p>
      <hr />
      <p><b>24 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b></p>
      <p><strong>24.1 Limit:</strong> Without limiting any exclusion of liability under this Agreement, the Organiser’s maximum aggregate liability under or in connection with this Agreement shall not exceed 25% of the Stall Fee.</p>
      <p><strong>24.2 Losses:</strong> The Organiser will not be liable for any loss of profits or any consequential, indirect or special loss, damage or injury of any kind whatsoever suffered by the Stallholder arising directly or indirectly from any breach of any of the Organiser’s obligations arising under or in connection with this Agreement or from any expiry or earlier termination of this Agreement or from any negligence, misrepresentation or other act or omission on the part of the Organiser, its employees, agents or contractors.</p>
      <hr />
      <p><b>25 FORCE MAJEURE</b></p>
      <p><strong>25.1</strong> Subject to this clause, a party shall not be liable for any act, omission or failure under this Agreement if that act, omission or failure arises directly from circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the party concerned (including damage to the Event Site, extreme weather conditions, civil disruption, or industry wide industrial action) <strong>(“Force Majeure Event")</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>25.2</strong> A party seeking to rely on clause 25.1 must promptly give the other party written notice of the circumstances and the way in which, and the extent to which, performance of its obligations are prevented or impeded by the Force Majeure Event.</p>
      <p><strong>25.3</strong> The party whose obligations are affected by the Force Majeure Event is to take all reasonably practicable steps to limit the effects of that event on the performance of its obligations under this licence.</p>
      <hr />
      <p><b>26 GENERAL</b></p>
      <p><strong>26.1 Severability:</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes unlawful or unenforceable it shall be treated as severable from the other provisions of this Agreement which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
      <p><strong>26.2 Variation and Waiver:</strong> The provisions of this Agreement may only be varied or waived by written agreement signed by the parties. Any delay or failure to exercise any remedy is not a waiver.</p>
      <p><strong>26.3 Governing Law and Jurisdiction:</strong> This Agreement is governed by the laws of New Zealand. The parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand courts, and shall not object to the exercise of jurisdiction by those courts.</p>
      <p><strong>26.4 Execution:</strong> The persons executing this Agreement confirm that they are authorised to do so to bind the party they sign for and on behalf of.</p>
      <p><strong>26.5 Counterparts:</strong> This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterpart copies which, read together, shall constitute one and the same instrument. A party may enter into this Agreement by signing a counterpart copy and sending it to the other party, including by email. Any signed facsimile or signed, scanned and emailed copy of this Agreement evidencing the execution of this Agreement by a party may be relied on by the other party as though it were an original copy. This Agreement is binding on the parties on the exchange of its counterparts by fax or email.</p>
      <p><strong>26.7 Privity:</strong> For the purposes of Part 2, Subpart 1 of the Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, the Stallholder acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Agreement are intended to confer a benefit on ATEED and accordingly ATEED shall have the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement as if ATEED had directly been a party to this Agreement.</p>
